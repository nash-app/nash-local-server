 # File Organization Rules

## Client-Server Files

### LLM Client

- The LLM client must be maintained in a single file at `llm_client.py`
- No alternate versions (e.g., `python:llm_client.py`) should be created
- If changes are needed, modify the main file directly
- Use version control (git) for tracking changes instead of creating duplicate files

### File Locations

- Client: `client_example.py` in the root directory
- Server: `app/server.py` in the app directory
- Tests: `tests/` directory
- Configuration: `.env` for environment variables, `pyproject.toml` for dependencies

### Best Practices

1. Always work on the canonical file paths
2. Use git branches for experimental changes
3. Use meaningful commit messages to track file evolution
4. Run tests before committing changes
5. Document significant changes in commit messages
