 # Project Rules

## Dependency Management

This project uses `pyproject.toml` for dependency management instead of `requirements.txt`. This is the modern Python packaging standard that provides better dependency resolution and project metadata management.

### Adding New Dependencies

When adding new dependencies to the project, use `poetry add`

### Development Dependencies

Development dependencies should be added to the `[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]` section:

```toml
[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]
pytest = ">=7.0.0"
black = ">=22.0.0"
isort = ">=5.0.0"
```

### Installing Dependencies

```bash
poetry install
```
